# Predicted Structures of Counter Defense Viral Proteins of Plant viruses
This repository contains the 3D structure of *counter defense viral protein of 58 plant viruses* predicted using two state-of-the-art protein structure prediction tools:
- [AlphaFold2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)
- [I-TASSER](https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/)

This is an unprecedented resource that has not been previously reported. Structure of protein is most important out of all protein’s features, as it determines completely how the protein functions and interacts with other molecules. Protein structure governs their functions which can be further employed for drug discovery, antibody designs and understanding protein–protein interactions

This repository contains the 3D structure and result obtained from MUSCLE of counter defense viral protein of 58 plant viruses predicted using two state-of-the-art protein structure prediction tools.
